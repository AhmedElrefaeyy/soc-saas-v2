"""039_tighten_detection_rules

Revision ID: 039
Revises: 038
Create Date: 2026-06-30

Tighten 11 high-false-positive detection rules for all existing tenants.

Only system-seeded rules (created_by_id IS NULL) are updated so that
tenant-customised rules are left untouched.

Changes per rule:
  1. "Linux sudo Privilege Escalation"
       → "Linux sudo - Shell or Interpreter Privilege Escalation"
       Adds command-pattern filter; no longer fires on every sudo call.

  2. "Account Lockout Detected (Event 4740)"
       → "Account Lockout Storm - Password Spray Indicator (Event 4740)"
       Changed from pattern (fires on 1 lockout) to threshold (3+ in 10 min).

  3. "Kerberoasting Indicator - Kerberos Pre-Auth Failure (Event 4771)"
       → "Kerberoasting / AS-REP Roast - Pre-Auth Failure Burst (Event 4771)"
       Changed from pattern (fires on 1 failure) to threshold (10+ in 5 min).
       Severity raised medium → high.

  4. "Scheduled Task Created (Event 4698)"
       → "Scheduled Task Created via Suspicious Binary or Location (Event 4698)"
       Now requires suspicious path / LOLBin / encoded command.
       Severity raised medium → high.

  5. "New Service Installed (Event 7045)"
       → "New Service Installed from Suspicious Path or Binary (Event 7045)"
       Now requires suspicious path or LOLBin binary.

  6. "Kernel Driver Loaded - Sysmon Event 6"
       → "Kernel Driver Loaded - Unsigned or Suspicious Driver (Sysmon Event 6)"
       Now requires unsigned driver or suspicious load path.

  7. "Remote Interactive Logon (RDP / Type 10) Detected"
       → "RDP Logon from External Network (Type 10)"
       Now excludes RFC-1918 source IPs; suppression extended 600 → 3600 s.
       Added Initial Access tactic.

  8. "Network Logon to Administrative Share (Type 3)"
       → "Lateral Movement - Rapid Network Logon Spread to Multiple Hosts (Type 3)"
       Changed from pattern (fires on every type-3 logon) to threshold
       (4+ distinct hosts per user in 5 min).  Severity raised medium → high.

  9. "Archive / Compression Tool Execution Before Exfiltration"
       → "Archive Tool - Password-Protected Staging of User Data"
       Now requires password flag + user data path, or execution from temp path.
       Severity raised low → medium.

 10. "Discovery - Active Directory Enumeration Tools"
       → "Discovery - Active Directory Attack Tool Detected"
       Removed standard RSAT cmdlets (Get-ADUser, Get-ADComputer, Get-ADGroup);
       added PowerView-specific attack cmdlets.

 11. "C2 - PowerShell Direct TCP Socket Connection"
       StreamReader condition tightened: now requires co-occurrence with IP address.

 12. "LSASS Access - Credential Dump Attempt"
       Removed the overly-broad regex `\\blsass\\.exe.*\\s+-` (matched any process
       referencing lsass.exe with any hyphenated flag — fired constantly on AV/EDR
       agents and monitoring scripts).  Condition 2 (comsvcs MiniDump) now requires
       rundll32.exe as the calling process.  Added exclusion list for known diagnostic
       binaries (WerFault, taskmgr, procexp, MsMpEng, lsaiso).  Added dedicated
       dump-tool names (nanodump, pypykatz).  Suppression extended 300 → 3600 s.
