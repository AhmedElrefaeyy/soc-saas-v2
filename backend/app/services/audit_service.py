    Records immutable audit entries for every security-relevant mutation.

    Hash chaining: each entry carries `prev_hash` (the previous entry's
    `entry_hash` in this tenant's chain) and `entry_hash` (SHA-256 of the
    canonical serialization of all fields including prev_hash).  This allows
    offline forensic verification that no rows were inserted, modified, or
    deleted between two known checkpoints.
